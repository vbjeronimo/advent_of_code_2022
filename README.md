# Advent of Code 2022
This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I started working through these puzzles to relearn C (which I haven't touched
since I finished an OS course at university), and as a way of practicing some
problem solving.

If you happen to have a look at my solutions and you notice something that can
be done better, feel free to raise a PR, or give me a shout at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-jeronimo/),
or my email (vitor.bently@hotmail.com).
